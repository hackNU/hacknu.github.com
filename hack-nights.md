## What is a Hack Night?

Hack night is a night where everyone comes together to hack on and build anything they want! 

HackNorthwestern hosts weekly hack nights, where you'll find people working on things like new web services, apps, video games, film scripts, academic research, homework, or just learning something new. You don't have to be a expert at anything to show up, learn, build, meet people, and have fun!

TL;DR Awesome people working on awesome stuff!
