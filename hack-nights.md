## What is a Hack Night?

TL;DR Awesome people working on awesome stuff!

Hack night is a night where everyone comes together to hack on and build anything they want, and we feed you too!

HackNorthwestern hosts weekly hack nights, where you'll find people working on things like new web services, apps, video games, film scripts, academic research, homework, or just learning something new. You don't have to be an expert at anything to show up. Come learn, build, meet people, and have fun!

<h4>This quarter Hack Nights will be held on Tuesday nights from 7PM until we get kicked out of our room</h5>
