imo Hackathon@Northwestern is an event hosted by Hack Northwestern and sponsored by [imo.im](http://imo.im), a quickly growing Silicon Valley start-up co-founded by one of the first 10 employees at Google. The hackathon is designed for students in the Chicago-land area to build collaborative apps that can be discoverable by imo’s millions of users.

We want this hackathon to be fun while allowing students to show off their skills - and get rewarded for their talents.

Coders will have have 22 hours to build an app for the chance to win big prizes and get a leg up in imo’s recruiting process. And of course, it wouldn't be an event without free food and swag.

This is Hack NU’s first hackathon and yet another one in Northwestern’s tradition of excellent hackathons, and we’re excited to have you show your innovation and creativity in a real-world situation with tangible, real-world results.

This event is open to all university students, not just Northwestern students. Just remember your university email address!

**If you are attending the event and would like to send your resume in before or after the event, please email jobs@imo.im with the subject line JOB ID: 012.**

Check out the [rules section](#rules) for more details.

Please email [hackathon@imo.im](mailto:hackathon@imo.im) with any questions.

# Judging Criteria

<p style="color:#bbb;text-align:right;"><a href="#about_the_hackathon" style="color:inherit;">back to the top</a></p>

Projects will be judged on creativity and execution, the latter of which will have a higher weight. Execution is divided into three parts: stability, usability, functionality. Keep in might that contestants are building their projects within a short time frame so stability and usability should not be given much weight. It’s more important that a project is functional and does what it’s supposed to do.


## Breakdown

- Creativity - 25%
- Functionality - 50%
- Usability - 15%
- Stability - 10%

<br>

When brothers Ralph and Georges Harik began using what would come to be known as [imo.im](http://imo.im), they had one goal - to make it easier to keep in touch with each other and their transcontinental family. They quickly realized how important communication is in our day-to-day activities, and decided to turn imo.im into what you see today - an instant messaging platform with more than 700,000 daily unique users who send more than 50 million messages per day. The mobile apps have had more than 5 million mobile downloads and 7 million unique users - and we’re not slowing down any time soon.

Based in Silicon Valley, imo.im is a fast-growing start-up founded by one of the first 10 employees at Google. We’re building products that help millions of people around the world connect with their friends and make new ones.

Through features like voice IMs, location sharing, group photos, voice calling and more, imo.im has been built with users like you always in mind.

Our team is highly motivated, hardworking and loves to solve problems. More importantly, we have fun and love what we do. 

We’re really excited to sponsor this hackathon, and can’t wait to see what you come up with!
