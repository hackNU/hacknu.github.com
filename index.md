**Wednesday, Oct 17, 2012 | 7:30pm | Tech LR5**

- **There will be free pizza, tshirts, and lots of cool swag at this event.**

- Meet the founders of [Seelio](http://seelio.com/), a venture-backed tech startup, and learn how they brought their idea to life using innovative technologies and human-centered art & design principles.

- [Seelio](http://seelio.com) is a online portfolio recruiting platform. Traditional resumes and job-search websites are broken; they make everyone look and sound the same. Seelio enables students to **showcase** their works, passions, and personalities and apply **directly** to jobs at companies such as [Facebook](http://seelio.com/orgs/facebook), [Twitter](http://seelio.com/orgs/Twitter) and [Palantir](http://seelio.com/orgs/Palantir).

- Seelio was recently featured in [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/06/no-more-boring-resumes-seelio-lets-college-students-showcase-their-work-helps-employers-find-them/), [Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/06/seelio-launches-social-network-for-students-to-land-a-dream-job/), and [Life Hacker](http://lifehacker.com/5936205/how-can-i-sell-my-skills-beyond-a-boring-resume).
